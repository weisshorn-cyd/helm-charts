# helm-charts

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repository as follows:

```console
helm repo add weisshorn-cyd https://weisshorn-cyd.github.io/helm-charts
```

You can then run `helm search repo weisshorn-cyd` to see the charts.
